# Workbench

![Stable Diffusion illustration of a wizard's cluttered workshop](193496338_surrealist__illustration_of_a_workbench_cluttered_with_colorful_objects_and_items_representing_the_u.png)

A simple brainstorming space, powered by the github frontend, a github action, and a simple python script.

For people who don't mind sharing their ideas or their brainstorming process publicly.  
Remember: there are no bad ideas in brainstorming.

# Setup

2. Click on the "Actions" tab and activate github action workflows on your fork.
3. Change the name of `README.stub.template` to `README.stub`

<!--
2. Set "write" access on your `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`, [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository#configuring-the-default-github_token-permissions) here.

# Usage

1. Select `Add File > Create New File` to add a new markdown file containing the idea you want to log. Let's call this an "article".
2. Upon committing, a github action runs which builds the README, which is customizable from a template.

The generated `README.md` will contain a Table of Contents of your articles, and supports the following features:

* Infers modification date from commit history
* Sort most recently modified ideas at the top
* Hyperlink to document using markdown title as anchor text
* An "estimated idea maturity" metric (it's just character count atm).
* Custom tagging
* Wikipedia-esque "category" pages which group articles by tag

### Rules to keep stuff from breaking

1. article filenames contain no whitespace and use the `.md` suffix
2. the first line of a markdown article you want added to the README TOC starts with a single 'pound' character (i.e. defines an H1 element for the document title).
3. use `lightgrey` badges to add a tag to an idea. Yes, this is begging for a simpler approach.

If you don't like these rules, I welcome PRs ;)


# FAQ

### I added a markdown file and nothing changed

It takes a few seconds for the workflow that updates the README to run. Try waiting a few minutes and refreshing the page. 

If you get impatient, click on the "Actions" tab and make sure there's an entry associated with your most recent commit 
with a green check mark next to it. A red X means something went wrong, a yellow circle means the workflow is still running.

### How does the README build itself?
